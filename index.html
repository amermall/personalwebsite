        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p id="test">
          I have been in the Information Technology(IT) field for the last 20
          years. The journey has allowed me to interact with many different
          types of technology. During that time, I have always wanted to learn
          programming. And at times trying to pursue that skill has been proven
          difficult, whether due to life circumstances or underestimating the
          time involved to be proficient at the skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the kids have gotten older and have become more self-sufficient, it
          seems the right time to pursue this goal. I will be going through the
          Flatiron Software Engineering Flex program, as it will allow me to
          work around my work schedule. Looking forward to starting this
          journey...and finishing it!
        </p>
