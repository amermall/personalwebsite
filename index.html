        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p id="test">
          I have been in the Information Technology(IT) field for the last 20
          years. The journey has allowed me to interact with many different
          types of technology. During that time, I have always wanted to learn
          programming. And at times trying to pursue that skill has been proven
          difficult; whether due to life circumstances or under-estimating the
          time involved to learning the skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the kids have gotten older and have become more self-sufficient, it
          seems the right time to pursue this goal. As the kids will be working
          on their homework, I will be learning to <strong>code!</strong>. As, I
          have been going through the pre-work check points for the Flatiron
          Software Engineering Flex program , I am reminded how hard it can be
          to learn a new skill, and how much time it can to take to grasp new
          concepts. It's almost like learning a new language. Actually, while
          typing this, I remembered from the
          <em>Programming as a conversation</em> check point;
          <code
            >"...the programming language defines the rules of notation or
            <strong>syntax</strong>, that are required for it to ask the
            computer to do work on your behalf..."</code
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to starting this journey...and finishing it!
          <strong>All the best to others in the same class!</strong>
        </p>
