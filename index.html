    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>
      I have been in the Information Technology(IT) field for the last 20 years.
      The journey has allowed me to interact with many different types of
      technology. During that time, I have always wanted to learn programming.
      And at times trying to pursue that skill has been proven difficult,
      whether due to life circumstances or underestimating the time involved to
      be proficient at the skill.

    <p>
      As the kids have gotten older and have become self-sufficient, it seems
      the right time to pursue this goal. I will working the Flatiron Software
      Engineering Flex program, as it will allow me to work around my work
      schedule. Looking forward to starting this journey...
